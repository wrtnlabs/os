## How to manage Issue

## How to manage Open Source?

To what extent should we open our resources? How much private documentation should we reveal in public-facing materials?  

This section aims to provide guidelines and answer questions, such as whether comments must exclusively be written in English.

### How Much Should Be Open?  

For service-related code, make everything public.  

However, to prevent token leaks, it's recommended to thoroughly check the `git log` using tools like [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) before uploading the code.  

If running such checks feels cumbersome, you may simplify the process by squashing the git log before uploading.  

### Can I Attach Internal Documents Like Slack or Figma to Issues or PRs?

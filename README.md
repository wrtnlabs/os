## üêû Bug Reports

### How to Report a Bug

1. Click the "New Issue" button in the [Issues tab](../../issues)
2. Select the "Bug Report" template
3. Please provide the following information in detail:
   - Environment (OS, Browser version, etc.)
   - Steps to reproduce the bug
   - Expected behavior vs Actual behavior
   - Screenshots or videos (if possible)
4. Add appropriate label:
   - `Bug`: For technical issues and malfunctions
   - `Request For Change UI`: For UI-related changes and improvements

### Bug Resolution Process

1. Create an initial issue in this main repository
2. Through discussion in the issue, identify the bug location and assign responsible team members
3. Create derivative issues in relevant repositories and link them to the main issue
   - This ensures all stakeholders can track the issue's progress in the main repository
   - Prevents visibility issues that would occur if issues were directly created in individual repositories
4. Issues are closed progressively after resolution
